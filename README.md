# CarbonPrediction
A Python-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model system, which is capable of accurately predicting hourly carbon emissions for the next 24 hours(can be longer)

Version: 1.0  
Authors: Yin Zhang

## 1. Regions covered  
If energy and weather data could be collected for a specific area, this program could theoretically predict any area.   
Currently, only the California region is available for information purposes only as an example. 

## 2. Data Sources
CA(US) region  
 Energy data collected from [CAISO](https://www.gridstatus.io/graph/fuel-mix?iso=caiso&date=2024-07-15to2024-07-29](https://www.gridstatus.io/graph/fuel-mix?iso=caiso&date=2024-07-15to2024-07-29)) Weather data collected from [VisualCrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services)
 
## 3. Background to the calculation of carbon emissions
### 3.1 Carbon Intensity and Carbon Emissions  
This code provides a flow of calculations from energy carbon intensity to carbon emissions. It first calculates the carbon intensity per hour based on the carbon emission factors and contribution ratios of each energy source, and then converts it to carbon emissions.

First, we use the following formula for calculating avg carbon intensity:
![Carbon Intensity Formula](image/Carbon%20Intensity%20Formula.png)
 , where

CIavg = Average carbon intensity (real-time or forecast) of a region  
Ei = Electricity produced by source i.  
CEFi = Carbon emission factor (lifecycle/direct) of source i.

Thenï¼Œwe use Carbon Emission Formula for calculating carbon emission coresponding to energy data:

Finally, apply Unit Conversion Formula to get the accurate data with correct unit:

### 3.2 Usage  
The [Carbon Emission Calculator](src/Carbon_Emission_Calculator_2.py) program provides data loading, cleaning and calculation functions for calculating total carbon emissions from different energy combinations.  

## 4. Run Carbon Emission Calculator and Main code with existing datasets and models
### 4.1 Installing dependencies

Carbon Emission Calculator requires Python3.  
Other required packages:

- Required python modules are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
  Run `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` for installing the dependencies.

### 4.2 Running CarbonPrediction using saved data:
The saved data needs to be inputed into the [Carbon Emission Calculator](src/Carbon_Emission_Calculator_2.py).  
From the example, the inputed data should be [Energy data](data/CAISO%205%20minute%20standardized%20data_2024-07-15T00_00_00-07_00_2024-07-29T23_59_59.999000-07_00.csv), and the outputed data should be [Energy + Emission combined data](data/combined_energy_data_with_emission_2.csv).  
You can directly download the data using the link before. No need to modify the contents of the document.  
After getting the output, input it to the [CarbonPrediction](src/CarbonPrediction.py) to get the result and the image of the prediction line.

## 5. Running CarbonPrediction from scratch
To run CarbonPrediction from scratch (with new data/for new regions etc.), first install the dependencies mentioned in Section 4.1.  
### 5.1 Getting weather/energy data     
You can download any weather data you want from the Internet. Then, make sure that the interval between each row of data is one hour. Similarly, Repeat the above for your own energy data. 
### 5.2 Calculating Carbon Emission corresopnding to energy data    
After having two data files, make sure that they are csv files and each column corresponds to a different energy and weather type. Next, open [Carbon Emission Calculator](src/Carbon_Emission_Calculator_2.py) and change the path of the code at line92 to match the path of your energy data file. Note that, you should make sure that all of the files have to be in one floder. 
### 5.3 Getting carbon emission forecasts using CarbonPrediction  
Input the new csv file which outputed from the [Carbon Emission Calculator](src/Carbon_Emission_Calculator_2.py) to [CarbonPrediction](src/CarbonPrediction.py) by changing file path in line14, and input your own weather data by changing the path in line 10.  
If you need data which is more than 24 hours, you can change the sequence_length in ine 42. Note that the larger the sequence_length, the lower the precision rate afterward.
