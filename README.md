# 1. Regions covered  
If energy and weather data could be collected for a specific area, this program could theoretically predict any area.  
Currently, only the California region is available for information purposes only.  
CA(US) region energy data collected from [CAISO]([https://www.caiso.com/todays-outlook/emissions#section-current](https://www.gridstatus.io/graph/fuel-mix?iso=caiso&date=2024-07-15to2024-07-29))
weather data collected from [VisualCrossig](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services)
